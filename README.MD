# rSUNC

rSUNC is an effort to modernize the now old Unified Naming Convention, built by Script-Ware for their Script-Ware V2 script executor years ago. This convention is partially retro-compatible with UNC, however it is not guaranteed that all UNC scripts will run on rSUNC compliant environments.
