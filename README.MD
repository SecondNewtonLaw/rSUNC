# rSUNC

rSUNC is an effort to modernize the now old Unified Naming Convention, built by Script-Ware for their Script-Ware V2 script executor years ago. This convention is partially retro-compatible with UNC, however it is not guaranteed that all UNC scripts will run on rSUNC compliant environments.

Once rSUNC completes its first initial full spec release, functions will be marked as either `@deprecated`, `@since` and with the `@unrelased` tags in order to signify the version at which they were added into the rSUNC spec.

### How to build

This project uses [Moonwave](https://eryn.io/moonwave/) a documentation generator for Lua(u) projects. From which we generate the webpage for the documents present at `/impl`.

1. Get NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Once installed, run `npm i -g moonwave@latest`
3. After all is installed, you may do a local preview by running `dev.bat` on your local windows install.
4. Profit!
