### Impl

Thank you for trying to (I assume) contribute to rSUNC!

We have a few series of tags to organize the final Moonwave output.

To mark your new luau file as a 'Library', please tag it with the `Library` tag.

If your new file is a 'Type', then please tag it with the `Type` tag.

This allows Moonwave to automatically sort this out for us!

#### Categorizing Class Members

We have the following categories for class members:
- Constructor
    - As the name suggests, it is a factory function. Set it using the `Constructor` tag on any library or type function to allow it to be shown as one! 

- Optional
    - This function is not obligatory for the executor to be rSUNC compliant.
