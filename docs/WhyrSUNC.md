# Why should you use rSUNC?

rSUNC is built from the ground up with brand new libraries and functions. They provide a brand new way of using executors, as well as handing off more control to script developers and providing new functions required thanks to the changes brought in to ROBLOX's Luau VM, such as Native Code Generation!

These libraries ensure that rSUNC can stay up-to-date with the latest developments, as well as providing a brand new working base for new executors, who would otherwise be implementing UNC, a standard that has began to show its age more and more.
