# How can I contribute to rSUNC

Great! Thanks for trying to contribute to rSUNC. To contribute to rSUNC, you may fork our [repository](https://github.com/SecondNewtonLaw/rSUNC) to begin.

Then, head to either the `docs` or the `impl` folder, in which you will find a variety of files. To edit the documentation of rSUNC, which includes information on the spec and other details, edit the `docs` folder. If you want to add a new Library or edit one, head to the `impl/Libraries/` folder, and edit or create the appropriate library, which you must tag according to the readme inside of `impl/`.

If you need to create a new native type, say to represent a native structure in C/C++, then you must create a new definition in the `impl/Types`

Once you have contributed, add yourself to the README's Contributors section, and make a pull request.
